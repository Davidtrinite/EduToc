# To-do

## Amplify Framework
Develop moible application using amplify framework. Use components together or on their own

## Configure Backend
Use the Amplifity CLI to create a new AWS backend-- 
 
We have the client (EdToc) which is an app that needs to read and write videos to the server and a cdn 
like Fastly for loading videos from cache, avoiding requests to the server when possible.  this is simplified. 

The second part of the problem is presenting the videos to the user. There needs to be efficient pre-loaded the
videos as the user scrolls that way the experience is seamless giving an impression of an endless feed of videos. 
That's just half of the equation the other part is the recommendation engine-- an alogrithim to recomend educational 
content based on interests but this has too many variables and would take way too much time to build out in this 
24 hour hackathon

## Connect application through Amplift console to Github repository 

Use Amplify libraries to connect cloud backend to the appication -- for short from video content.

## intergrate UI components 

Amplify UI components  
  
# AWS Amplift Console

Host static app on AWS

## Connect the repository

## Configure build settings
